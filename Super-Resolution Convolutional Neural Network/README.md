# Single-Image Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

This project is based on a paper written by Chao Dong in 2015.

Pre-requisites to using this program are -
  * Create a directory named SRCNN and inside that, create three folders namely 'source', 'images', and 'output'.
  * Add your original and high quality images to the 'source' folder.
  * Upload the data set and the source code in the SRCNN folder, i.e., the main directory.

Thank You!
